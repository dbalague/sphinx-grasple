### New ✨

`sphinx-exercise` incorporates GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy our code.

### Improved 👌

Reference placeholders such as _{name}_ and _{number}_ can be used simultaneously while _%s_ works only if not referenced with other placeholders.

### Fixes 🐛

- Manifest path has been fixed to recursively include all CSS and JavaScript files.
- Namespace was removed from `setup.py`.
- ReadTheDocs builds documentation using a dev mode environment through the `rtd` extra.
